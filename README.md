# Welcome to Impact Tracker by the HelgitasðŸ‘µ

## Presentation

The Helgitas is a group of dedicated people who took several weeks to help the foundation [Pro Juventute](https://www.projuventute.ch/fr/home) whose aim is to support parents and assist children and young people so that the latter can become self-reliant and responsible individuals.

The result is a web application: **Impact Tracker**, that helps you define KPIs and follow their progress.

## How to run the app

What you can do with this app depends on the role you have: economist or gatekeeper:
* Gatekeepers can define KPIs and associate them with circles.
* Economists can set values to their associated KPIs.

## References

The web application uses the following technologies:

* [React](https://react.dev/) library
* [AntDesign](https://ant.design/) (and its third-party libraries), a React UI framework
* [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
* Supabase SSO

And we used the help of ChatGPT from time to time.
