# Technology Stack

For the KPI project, we chose to use the following technologies:

* Backend: **Django** (Python framework) 

Django is an open-source web framework useful to start developing projects fast. It contains built-in useful features like security and login. It also works well with Supabase that we are planning to use.
In addition, our backend is familiar with this framework.

* Frontend: **TypeScript** and **ReactJS**

These are the technologies our frontend developer is most familiar with and whose features will answer our needs.

* Database: **Supabase** (PostgreSQL)

Supabase is well-known and appreciated within the developers of our team. And it fits our needs.

For deployment, we plan to use **Fly.io.** because it supports frontend, backend and database. We also have developers familiar with it, and it is easy to use.
