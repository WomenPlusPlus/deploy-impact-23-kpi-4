## How we communicate

We communicate via Slack, in the channel [kpi-app-4](https://women-4gs1079.slack.com/archives/C05S82D42AF).
We meet virtually with Slack huddles. 

To avoid being overwhelmed with information and lose our focus, we have defined the following rules:
For everything related to the project and the product we want to implement, our main person of contact with the outside world is our PM, Petra.
For everything related to agile (retrospective, deliverables etc.) the person of contact is our Scrum Master, Amélie.

## Ceremonies

### Standups

Given the complexity of meeting with our different agendas, we chose to do the stand-ups in a written mode, in a dedicated slack channel ([kpi-app-4-standups](https://women-4gs1079.slack.com/archives/C05U0RT16NQ)).
Every day, the Scrum Master will initiate the daily standup by sending a message. Each member of the team will answer the three questions (What did I do? What will I do? What’s blocking me?) directly in the channel. 
If someone wants to react/help a team member, the person will open a thread on the relevant message.

### Retrospectives

The goal of a retrospective is for each team member to pause and reflect on the past week so that the team can improve itself (communication, processes, etc.).

We do our retrospectives on Friday afternoons.
To make the meeting efficient and smooth, each team member will think about the following questions beforehand:
* What work has been done well in this sprint?
* What work hasn’t been done well?
* What should we start doing to improve?
If possible, the team members will fill in a form with the answers to these questions. This will enable the Scrum Master to better prepare the retrospective by grouping similar items.

### Sprint Review and Sprint Planning

The sprint review and sprint planning happen on Monday mornings.
